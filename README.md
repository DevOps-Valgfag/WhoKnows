## üõ†Ô∏è Setting Up the Project Locally

To get the project up and running on your local machine, please follow these steps.

### Prerequisites ‚úÖ

Before you begin, ensure you have the following software installed on your system.

1.  **Ruby:** This project requires Ruby. Version 3.0 or higher is recommended. To check your Ruby version, run the following command in your terminal:
    ```sh
    ruby -v
    ```
    If you don't have Ruby installed, you can download it from the official [Ruby website](https://www.ruby-lang.org/).

2.  **Bundler:** Bundler is a package manager for Ruby. To install it, run:
    ```sh
    gem install bundler
    ```

3.  **SQLite3:** This project uses SQLite3 as its database. You can verify if it's installed by running:
    ```sh
    sqlite3 --version
    ```
    If it's not installed, you can find installation instructions on the [SQLite website](https://www.sqlite.org/).
### üöÄ Setup Instructions

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    First, clone the project repository to your local machine.
    ```sh
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd <project-directory>
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    Next, install the necessary Ruby gems. To keep the gems local to the project and avoid conflicts with system-wide gems, it is recommended to configure Bundler to install dependencies into the `vendor/bundle` directory.

    Run this command first:
    ```sh
    bundle config set --local path 'vendor/bundle'
    ```
    Now, install the gems:
    ```sh
    bundle install
    ```

3.  **Download the Database:**
    This project uses a pre-existing database file. You will need to download the official `whoknows.db` file from the provided external source and place it in the root directory of the project.

4.  **Configure Environment Variables:**
    The application requires a `SESSION_SECRET` for security. Create a `.env` file in the new_app_ruby folder:
    ```sh
    touch .env
    ```
    Then, add the following line to the `.env` file:
    ```env
    SESSION_SECRET=your_super_secret_key
    ```
    You can generate a secure secret key by running the following command in your terminal and copying the output:
    ```sh
    ruby -r securerandom -e 'puts SecureRandom.hex(64)'
    ```

### Running the Application

Once you have completed the setup steps, you can start the application with the following command:

```sh
bundle exec ruby app.rb
```

The application will then be accessible at `http://localhost:8080`.

### Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues during the setup process, here are a few things to check:

*   **Missing Gems:** If you get an error about a missing gem, double-check that you have run `bundle install` successfully.
*   **Database Not Found:** Ensure that you have downloaded the `whoknows.db` file and placed it in the correct directory.
*   **Application Fails to Start:** Verify that your `.env` file is correctly named and that the `SESSION_SECRET` is set.

### Notes
- **Authentication**: Some endpoints may require the user to be logged in. Ensure you have a valid session.
- **Environment Variables**: The application uses a `SESSION_SECRET` for session management. Ensure this is configured in your `.env` file.
- **Database**: The application relies on an external SQLite database file. Ensure the database is downloaded and placed in the correct directory.

For more details, visit the [Swagger UI](http://localhost:8080/docs).

üêõ Known Issues

-   The `/api/weather` endpoint is dependent on an external weather service and may fail if the service is unavailable.
-   The database file must be manually downloaded and placed in the correct directory.



## Agreed conventions new version of the application - Ruby / Sinatra
According to https://rubystyle.guide/ 

| Concept/Context | Convention  | Example |
|-----------------|-------------|---------|

## Agreed branching strategy - Git Flow
We will work in feature branches, make PR to Dev branch and when the application is ready for deployment, this will be from the Main branch.

Flow and commands in order to avoid irreparable conflicts:
| Command | Desc.  | 
|-----------------|-------------|
| git checkout dev |  |
| git pull | Make sure your local dev is up to date |
| git checkout -b featureBranchName | Make a new branch from the updated dev  |
| git add . | |
| git commit -m "descriptive message" | Make regular commits with descriptive messages |
| git checkout dev |  |
| git pull | Make sure your local dev is up to date |
| git checkout featureBranchName |  |
| git merge dev | Merge dev into your feature branch and check if it still can compile* |
| git push -u origin featureBranchName | pusher din rebased branch til remote, klar til PR |

*If there are any conflicts during merge, solve these in the IDE (then save files, run git add <file> + git commit)

Make PR to dev in GitHub UI.


After PR has been reviewed and merged:

git checkout dev

git pull 

Now you can make a new feature branch from the updated dev branch and work on.

## üê≥ Running with Docker

This project is fully containerized with Docker. To run the application using Docker, follow these steps.

### Prerequisites ‚úÖ

-   **Docker:** Make sure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed on your system. You can download them from the [official Docker website](httpss://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

### üöÄ Running the Application

1.  **Build and Run the Container:**
    Navigate to the `new_app_ruby` directory and use Docker Compose to build and run the application in detached mode:
    ```sh
    cd new_app_ruby
    docker-compose up --build -d
    ```

    The application will be accessible at `http://localhost:8080`.

2.  **Stopping the Application:**
    To stop the running containers, use the following command:
    ```sh
    docker-compose down
    ```

### Troubleshooting

*   **Port Conflict:** If you get an error that port `8080` is already in use, you can change the port mapping in the `docker-compose.yml` file.
*   **`.env` file not found:** Make sure the `.env` file is in the `new_app_ruby` directory.
