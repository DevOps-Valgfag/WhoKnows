Problems we have fixed:
- python2 to python3 (used bash: $ 2to3 -w "filename") followed guide from lektion 1(after)
- run_forever.sh also think is fixed by using shellcheck for analysing the file and vim for correction
- whoknows.db is changed for the real whoknows.db

Problems we havenÂ´t fixed:
- python3 ./app.py dosent work it says flask is nowhere to be found
